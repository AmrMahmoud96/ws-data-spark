-------------------------
** Requests in DataSample.csv could be users who have indicated interest
in a product/company/service at a given time and location and the POIs
could be potential points of interest for said product to be dispensed.
(popularity would then outline the magnitude of people interested in
 having the product/company/service at that particular location)

POIs could refer to potential server locations on which customers are individually
requesting information from the server at a specified time and location.
Server requests from individuals are allocated to the nearest server for optimal response times.
(popularity would then outline magnitude of requests/load allocated to a given server)
